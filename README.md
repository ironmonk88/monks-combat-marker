# Monk's Combat Marker
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
It's just a bunch of little things to make the program run a little smoother and look a little better.  But a lot are based on personal preference.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Display an animated disc behind the token that currently has a turn in the encounter.


## Bug Reporting
I'm sure there are lots of issues with it.  It's very much a work in progress.
